<p>My wife and I love to hang out and have a good time, but we realize the importance of being safe and making good decisions. We've found that taking a cab is being responsible and taking a bad decsion out our hands.</p>
<p>However, we all need to know the law, and what they deem to be safe. It's important to know the limits of the drinking law and what happens when we fail to follow procedure.</p>
<p>This is bad vs. good, good and false boolean would reflect "Taking a cab home, is good.", and would make the initial statement incorrect.</p>
